 For example

    Have the server render views/index.ejs that has the form for the user to fill out
    The user fills out the form and submits
    The submitted form gets sent to /result,  
    The server recognizes when someone posts things to /result, grabs information from the POST, 
    and sends the POST data back as it renders views/results.ejs

    In this case
    The server recognizes when someone posts things to /result, grabs information from the POST, 
    --stores the post data to session
    and sends the POST data back as it renders views/results.ejs
